                        <h4>Why am I doing this?</h4>
                        <p>Just for fun, I wanna share for now my amateurishs creations that I hope will become profesional in the future, test out 
                            writing real page in HTML and CSS. I'm planning to add JS later on too. And I also wanna know how it is to have hosted page that can anyone acces.

                        <p>This page is primary for testing and for sharing my works that I wrote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a>.
                            You can look at them in paragraph <b>My codes</b>.
<!--                        <br>Maybe just maybe I'm gonna upload some videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ngofzYzPlJs4CJsbOh3TQ?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank">
                            youtube channel</a> where I'll be writing codes. -->

                        <h4>Which languages do I know?</h4>
                        <p>There are a lots of programming languages. I already know how to write codes in HTML with CSS and in Python. I'm planning to learn javascript
                            (yes, I wanna punish my soul), C#, C++ and maybe Java too.

                        <h4>My codes</h4>
                        <p>As I already said I can write in Python. I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/Joedmin580/Guessing_game" target="_blank">guessing game</a> and the
                        <a href="https://github.com/Joedmin580/Calculator" target="_blank">calculator</a>. My new mini-project is the <a href="https://github.com/Joedmin580/Geometric_calculator" target="_blank">geometric calculator</a>
                            which is able to calculate circuit, content, surface and volume of geometric bodies. I'll write something new later, all I need is the idea.<br>
                            For now is my <b>longest</b> code <i>geometric</i> calculator. Version <b>without GUI</b> has about <b>250 lines</b> and the version <b>with GUI</b> has <b>1769 lines</b>. The GUI version has mores shapes and goniometry in rectangular triangle what version without GUI doesn't.
                            I'll add more shapes and some more functions later on. Version without GUI won't get same functions as the version with GUI, because the GUI version will be later exported to .exe and the version without GUI will stay as .py so it's completely useless to update it.

                        <h4>My other works</h4>
                        <p>I love history, especially wars and tanks! My <b>favourite tank</b> is the Swedish Strv-103. <br>
                            I made <b>2</b> presentaions on it, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--AkA5wil6Zslitcjc2c-s1ifipa41NF/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">English one</a> and the 
                            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ezWVByjP0B2ctaGWsLUpiQWNJtOwBmo0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Czech one</a>. <br>
                            I made a lot of another works like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KQy6ILFjYTOv5hpTcLqhOEiYccV2Lk0b/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this one</a> which is about the 
                            Czechoslovakian army or <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vEwIHrAmb4Yom4VTD8Ay-BQEvpEkcgcw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this one</a> which is about the 1st 
                            tanks ever made, but <b>both are in Czech</b>. I also made a Czech presentaion about the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_gF4NgREZ4PmX0piFbr68PwJ373UNwN/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">D Day</a>
                            which is one of the most important or <b>the most important mission</b> of the World War II which <b>led allies to win</b> the <b>whole war</b>.

                        <h4>Do you wanna be programmer too?</h4>
                        <p>For newbies in programming (like I'm) I'd recomend to watch some <b>tutorials</b> on youtube on specific language, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ" target="_blank">this</a> channel has nice tutorials. 
                            I also recomend to do some excersises. The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3chools</a> has nice excersises, tests and quizzes. You can also look on some cheat sheets but a lot of time you won't look at 
                            them cuz you will <b>simply google it</b>. If you mean programming <b>seriously</b> (like I do) then it'd be great to <b>read some books</b>. I'm planning to read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HTxH-voa-yoHkj62e8jOMPgRmUIkLQO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Think Like a Programmer</a>, 
                            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWJfqpx1Vk_-4zS6asyMoWCY9ge2M38n/view?usp=sharing"  target="_blank">No Starch Python</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O-i_S0oihpsHfkoEi6m_jhkFa7SU3oUn/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Clean Code</a>.
                            All of them are in the English.

                        <h4>Little andventure game</h4>
                        <p>I had a task to do to school and I'd like to make a mini-project from it and make it a lot more bigger than they wanted from me, for now it's only in Czech but 
                            if I'm not gonna be lazy I'll translate it to English too. <a href="story_game/index.html" target="_blank">Here's the demo</a> of the Czech version.
