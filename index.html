                    <h4>Why am I doing this?</h4>
                    <p>Just for fun, I wanna share for now my amateurishs creations that I hope will become profesional in the future, test out 
                        writing real page in HTML and CSS. I'm planning to add JS later on too. And I also wanna know how it is to have hosted page that can anyone acces.</p>

                    <h4>For what am I gonna use this?</h4>
                    <p>This page is primary for testing and for sharing my works that I wrote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a>.
                        You can look at them in paragraph <b>My codes</b>.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h4>Which languages do I know?</h4>
                    <p>There are a lots of programming languages. I already know how to write codes in HTML with CSS and in Python. I'm planning to learn javascript
                        (yes, I wanna punish my soul), C#, C++ and maybe Java too.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h4>My codes</h4>
                    <p>As I already said I can write in Python. All my basic codes are <a href="https://github.com/Joedmin580/My-simple-codes">here</a>. My mini-project is the <a href="https://github.com/Joedmin580/Geometric_calculator" target="_blank">geometric calculator</a>
                        <b>with GUI</b>. It's able to calculate circuit, content, surface and volume of geometric bodies. For now it's my <b>longest</b> code.

                    <h4>My other works</h4>
                    <p>I love history, especially wars and tanks! My <b>favourite tank</b> is the Swedish Strv-103. I made <b>2</b> presentaions on it, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--AkA5wil6Zslitcjc2c-s1ifipa41NF/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">English one</a> and the 
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ezWVByjP0B2ctaGWsLUpiQWNJtOwBmo0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Czech one</a>. I made a lot of another works 
                        like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KQy6ILFjYTOv5hpTcLqhOEiYccV2Lk0b/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this one</a> which is about the 
                        Czechoslovakian army or <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vEwIHrAmb4Yom4VTD8Ay-BQEvpEkcgcw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this one</a> which is about the 1st 
                        tanks ever made, but <b>both are in Czech</b>. I also made a Czech presentaion about the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_gF4NgREZ4PmX0piFbr68PwJ373UNwN/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">D Day</a>
                        which is one of the most important or <b>the most important mission</b> of the World War II which <b>led allies to win</b> the <b>whole war</b>.

                    <h4>Do you wanna be programmer too?</h4>
                    <p>For newbies in programming (like I'm) I'd recomend to watch some <b>tutorials</b> on youtube on specific language, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ" target="_blank">this</a> channel has nice tutorials. 
                        I also recomend to do some excersises. The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3chools</a> has nice excersises, tests and quizzes. You can also look on some cheat sheets but a lot of time you won't look at 
                        them cuz you will <b>simply google it</b>. If you mean programming <b>seriously</b> (like I do) then it'd be great to <b>read some books</b>. I'm planning to read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HTxH-voa-yoHkj62e8jOMPgRmUIkLQO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Think Like a Programmer</a>, 
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWJfqpx1Vk_-4zS6asyMoWCY9ge2M38n/view?usp=sharing"  target="_blank">No Starch Python</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O-i_S0oihpsHfkoEi6m_jhkFa7SU3oUn/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Clean Code</a>.
                        All of them are in the English.

                    <h4>Little andventure game</h4>
                    <p>I had a task to do to school and I'd like to make a mini-project from it and make it a lot more bigger than they wanted from me, for now it's only in Czech but 
                        if I'm not gonna be lazy I'll translate it to English too. <a href="story_game/index.html" target="_blank">Here's the demo</a> of the Czech version.
