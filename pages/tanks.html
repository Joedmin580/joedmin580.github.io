						As you may know, WWII lasted from 1939 to 1945 and the
						main powers there were the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany,
						and later on the United States of America. The
						casualties were enormous, from 70 to 85 million. I'm
						sorry, but I'm not gonna tell you everything about WWII,
						gonna talk about tanks that were designed and used
						during WWII. I'm gonna talk about the most famous tanks
						from the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Great Britain, and

						For me is one of the most known soviet tanks, the medium
						tank T-34 and its later modifications like the T-34/85.
						It was first deployed against

						gun and 15&nbsp;-&nbsp;45&nbsp;mm 60°&nbsp;sloped armor
						which was very effective. The armor was later on
						increased to 20&nbsp;-&nbsp;70&nbsp;mm. The ammunition
						was increased from 76 rounds up to 100 rounds. Later on,
						the tank has got a new turret and the 85&nbsp;mm gun -
						the T-34/85. Armour was again increased to
						20&nbsp;-&nbsp;90&nbsp;mm. The latest version of this
						tank was the T-44 which had a new hull, turret, same gun
						as the T-34/85 but increased armor up to 120&nbsp;mm.
						The total number built is around 84,070 pieces. Another
						well-known tank, the heavy one, is the Kliment
						Voroshilov aka

						M18 Hellcat was the fastest armored fighting vehicle
						used by the USA, which was caused by minimal armor and
						the innovative automatic transition. It was the most
						effective US TD with the biggest kill-to-loss ratio than
						any other US TD in WWII. The armor was from 4.8 to
						25.4&nbsp;mm thick and the max speed was 97&nbsp;km/h
						on-road and about half off-road. The main gun was the
